For computing the heuristic, I wrote a mini helper function in graph_search.py. Also, to help keep track of my priority
queue and closed list, I incorporated the custom Node class from lecture. I also incorporated the use of a built-in Python
dictionary so that I could better keep track of my nodes. The custom world I built does not show a tracing of the path-
planning problem solved as I gathered data across multiple resolutions for both A-star and Dijsktra, and it was more
important to show data across those parameters.
